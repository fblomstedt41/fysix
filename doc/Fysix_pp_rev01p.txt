Background
----------
This document will organize requriements and software design in modules and deliverys against time.
Each software module will be statet with delivery time, testning and functional verification.


* TODO: Break down Function Specification to Requirement Specification!

Actions
--------

IMPLEMENTATION
1) Make Environment sharp and connect to Planet
2) Make collisionhandling. Handle different types of collisions like:
   - Weapon (shot, mine, etc.)
   - stuff to get (gameplay items, such as improved gun etc.)
   - another object (opponent ship, planet, etc.)
   - game area (map, 'hard' ground)
   + Find better naming...
3) Game functionality (player initial information / configuration)
   - Shot, kill, collision => stats (energy/score)
4) Make map (level handling)
   - Simple 'Level creator)
   - XML-file
5) Get one Player ship with fly porperties lik Gravity force, turboraketti and xpilot
   - There shall be many different ship types with unique flight apsects
6) Get the communication to work
   - Lag compensation (at server, do some handshake with client to measure lag, 'hold' updates for an average to get as fare as
     possible to many (hopefully all) players. If 'late' incomming control check this against 'history worl objects' and do some
     calculations against some possible changes, if it affect something let also the 'future' be affected and send updates to all
     clients...
   - Interpolation at clients (aginst server messages)
   - Await response to question to xpilot developers.

* DO THIS AGAINST REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION!
